Homework assignment for the GW coding book camp.

# jQuery Assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `week-4-game`, then clone it to your computer.

2. Inside the `week-4-game` folder, create an `index.html` file.

3. Still inside the `week-4-game` directory, make a folder called `assets`.
   * Inside the `assets` directory, make three additional folders: `javascript`, `css` and `images`.
     * In the `javascript` folder, make a file called `game.js`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `reset.css`. Paste into it the code found from the Meyerweb Reset.
     * In the images folder, save any of the images you plan on using.

4. Set up your repository to deploy to Github Pages.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub. 

### Here's how the app works:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
   
   * The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.

   * Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
